### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Nicholas Belbas, I'm a Cyber Engineering student at Houston Baptist University with an anticipated graduation date of May 2022

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a custom Wyze Camera formware that will allow for vehicle license plate logging. I'm also working on a project that uses a rooted Nest Smart Thermostat as a smart volume knob for a Sonos whole-home audio system.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of the Cisco IOS CLI and appmaking with the Flutter API
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a plugin for Forza Motorsports or BeamNG to communicate with an Oculus Rift 2 Dev Kit
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with automating my workflow for digitzing analog video tapes
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at nickshdmifilms@protonmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a bit of a data hoarder, I almost never delete files and I log everything...phone's texts and emails are backed up weekly to my NAS, all my calls are recorded, I record with a dashcam whenever I'm driving, and I never delete raw video or project files from videos I've produced for clients or myself
