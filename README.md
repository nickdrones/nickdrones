### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Nicholas Belbas, I'm a Cyber Engineering student at Houston Baptist University with an anticipated graduation date of May 2022

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a custom Wyze Camera firmware that will allow for vehicle license plate logging. I'm also keeping my phishing page attacker repository up-to-date whenever I receive a link in an email.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of the Cisco IOS CLI and appmaking with the Flutter API
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on trying to get audio drivers working on a Kabylake CHromebook running GalliumOS
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with automating my workflow for digitzing analog video tapes
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at nickshdmifilms @ protonmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a bit of a data hoarder, I almost never delete files and I log everything! My phone's texts and emails are backed up weekly to my NAS, all my calls are recorded, I record with a dashcam whenever I'm driving, and I never delete raw video or project files from videos I've produced for clients or myself
